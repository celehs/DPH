\arguments{
\item{time}{a vector of discrete time (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...)}

\item{status}{a vector of event status (1 = observed, 0 = censored)}

\item{pred}{a vector/matrix of predictors (e.g. biomarkers)}

\item{sens}{sensitivity (a scalar or vector)}

\item{spec}{specificity (a scalar or vector)}

\item{sens_known}{indicator of whether sensitivity is known}
